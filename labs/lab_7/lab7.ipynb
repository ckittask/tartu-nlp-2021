As you may remember, in Lab 5 we looked into text classification with CNN. We used the [ACL IMDB v.1 Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) that contains movie reviews classified as positive and negative. \n",

        "[DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is a general-purpose language representation model, which is distilled version of BERT base model. It retains almost all the language undestanding capabilities of BERT, but is smaller, faster and cheaper. It has 40% less parameters than BERT-base and runs 60% faster. \n",

These pre-trained models do not need a labeled datasets and can later be fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets. \n",
