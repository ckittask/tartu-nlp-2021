Welcome to the Natural Language Processing course!

Here, you will find the lab materials and homeworks. Lab materials with solutions will be uploaded after the practice.

If you have any questions about the homeworks or labs, I encourage you to use the [Piazza forum](https://www.piazza.com/ut.ee/spring2021/ltat01001/home). 
This allows for the other students to see your question and also participate in answering it.
